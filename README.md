#### I am Software Engineer and designer.
Since 2017 I've been living and breathing web development. I've been creating modern, clean and user friendly user interfaces, APIs and applications for all types and sizes of companies!
- In the frontend, I have a passion for developing high performance local/offline first and real time frontend applications.
- In the backend, building and using AI models is what makes my day.
